# The Responder:

The responder is a sister app to Tizzle. It is not required but offers extra functionality in that it allows user that receive recurring texts the option to disable said texts if they would like to. Alternatively since I designed Tizzle to be wary of spam abuse the user could just let the recurring texts play out. Still the functionality is there. I developed it in a seperate directory than Tizzle because it just seems to perform better that way. It was likely a null decision and will work fine but this is just how I ended up doing it. The application runs in its own window when launched from Tizzle and just waits for commands. It receives commands from the users text replies to the messages sent out by Tizzle. Group messages can be stopped for one person at a time and the administrator can query the application for `status` reports, as well as `shutdown` or `restart` the application remotely. I have only tested the behaviour on Verizon, At&T, Metro, and Cricket, but I hope I have it programmed to get the info no matter what.
